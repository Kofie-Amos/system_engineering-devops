This project introduces the basics of Linux file system navigation and fundamental shell commands, designed for those new to programming. Through these tasks, learners will gain hands-on experience in viewing directory contents, understanding file structures, and writing simple shell scripts to perform common operations. The goal is to build a foundational understanding of how to navigate and manage files within the Linux command-line interface.
